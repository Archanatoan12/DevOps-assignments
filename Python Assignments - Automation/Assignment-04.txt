Write a program that opens all .txt files in a folder and searches for any line that matches a user-supplied regular expression. The results should be printed to the screen. 


import os, re
def func(regex):
    for file in os.listdir():
        if file.endswith('.txt'):
            with open(file, 'r') as f:
                lines = f.readlines()
                for line in lines:
                    if re.search(regex, line):
                        print(line)

func(regex)
