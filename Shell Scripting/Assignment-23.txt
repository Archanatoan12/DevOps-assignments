Write a script that takes a single command line parameter intended to be the user's first name. Prompt the user for their age and read that into a variable. Using the appropriate method to make that command line parameter visible to a function, pass the age captured to the function and display a message to the user addressing them by name and confirming their age, add a calculation of their age in number of days.


#!/bin/bash

FIRST_NAME=$1

read -p "Enter your age: " AGE

display()
{
  echo "Your name is $1 and you are $2 years or $(( $2 * 365 )) days old."
}

display $FIRST_NAME $AGE
