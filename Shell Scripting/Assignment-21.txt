Create a simple script containing a single function. This function should display a message to clearly indicate it was generated when the function was run. Then, display another message outside the function clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.


#!/bin/bash

message_function()
{
  echo "This message is from INSIDE the function."
}

message_function
echo "This message is from OUTSIDE the function."
