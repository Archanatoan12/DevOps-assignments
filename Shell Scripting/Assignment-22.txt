Create a script to demonstrate the visibility of variables and when they are available within a script and its functions. Define a global variable, a function that defines a local variable and then display both BEFORE calling the function, call the function, then display both AFTER calling the function.


#!/bin/bash

GLOBAL_VARIABLE="GLOBAL_VARIABLE"

some_function()
{
  LOCAL_VARIABLE="LOCAL_VARIABLE"
}

echo "Before calling function: $GLOBAL_VARIABLE"
echo "Before calling function: $LOCAL_VARIABLE"

some_function

echo "After calling function: $GLOBAL_VARIABLE"
echo "After calling function: $LOCAL_VARIABLE"
