Create a script that prompts the user for a number. That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input). The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.


#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a number: " NUM

for count in `seq 1 $NUM`
do
  echo "This message count = $count"
done
