We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented languages. Create the following structures in your script:

a function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics of the indicated gender.


#!/bin/bash

GENDER=$1

gender_function()
{
  ARMS=2
  LEGS=2

  if [ $1 == "male" ]
  then
    male_function
  elif [ $1 == "female" ]
  then
    female_function
  fi
}

male_function()
{
  BEARDS=1
}

female_function()
{
  BEARDS=0
}

gender_function $GENDER

echo "ARMS: $ARMS"
echo "LEGS: $LEGS"
echo "BEARDS: $BEARDS"
