Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.


#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, this is a full sentence."
echo "Hello, this is another sentence but redirecting" > /dev/null
