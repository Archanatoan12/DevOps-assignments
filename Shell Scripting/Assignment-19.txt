We need to create a menu for our users. Display a menu containing three choices AND a choice to allow them to exit. Display that menu and prompt for a choice. Upon choosing the value, it should simply clear the screen and redisplay the menu (loop until the exit choice is given).

HOWEVER, we need to be sure that the end user cannot use CTL-C, CTL-Z or a KILL command to terminate the application. Add a 'trap' in the script to capture those attempts and provide instructions on how to exit the script using the menu choice instead.


#!/bin/bash

trap "echo ''; echo 'Choose the appropriate choice for exit to exit from script'" SIGINT SIGTSTP SIGKILL

while true
do
  echo "MENU ITEMS:"
  echo "1. French Fries"
  echo "2. Pizza"
  echo "3. Gobi Manchurian"
  echo "4. Exit"

  read -p "Enter the number corresponding to your item choice: " CHOICE

  case $CHOICE in
    1)
      clear
      ;;
    2)
      clear
      ;;
    3)
      clear
      ;;
    4)
      break
      ;;
  esac
done
